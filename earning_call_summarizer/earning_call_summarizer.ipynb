Apple CEO Tim Cook highlighted revenue records in over two dozen countries and significant growth in emerging markets like Malaysia, Mexico, and Poland. In services, Apple set a new all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions seeing double-digit growth. The installed base surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. The call also introduced Apple's Vision Pro, set to launch as an advanced personal electronics device focusing on spatial computing.\n",
            "\n",
            "iPhone revenue reached $69.7 billion, indicating a 6% year-over-year increase, with various regions setting records. Mac revenue was $7.8 billion, up 1%, driven by the latest M3-powered models. However, iPad revenue dropped 25% due to tough comparisons from prior launches and a shorter sales period. Wearables, home, and accessories saw an 11% revenue decline. Services revenue reached $23.1 billion, up 11%.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri discussed supply issues from the previous year that affected this year’s quarter results. Cook and Maestri emphasized Apple's focus on long-term investment, including in generative AI, and noted ongoing environmental and social initiatives. The meeting concluded with a Q&A session addressing market dynamics and Apple's future strategies.\"\n"
