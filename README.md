## üí° Featured Projects

- **signlanguage.io : Building Inclusive Communities for All**

  Our mission is to break the communication barriers for hearing and speaking-impaired communities by creating an effective and accessible sign language interpretation solution. Here we are transcribing continuous sign language video (ASL) to multiple languages in real-time. More details can be found [here](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2023/signlanguageio).

- **Do English Language Learner Students Write Like Published Authors**

  Previous Automated essay scoring (AES) experiments have shown that models that are trained from scratch performed on par or better than pre-trained transformer models, leading us to investigate whether models that rely less on pre-training and whether models that have been pre-trained on a more informal data source (Twitter) would serve as better predictors of English Language Learners‚Äô (ELLs‚Äô) essay scores when they are graded on six different essay components. We find that when we allowed BERT and a BERT-derived model (BERTbase-cased and BERTweet-base) to learn the training data by unfreezing layers, it allowed for them to predict a greater range of scores and thus performed better as shown by a lower MCRMSE (mean column-wise root mean squared error) score. The models could not learn the more extreme scores despite using K-means to cluster the data into low scores, average scores, and high scores and performing k-fold cross-validation with our experimental models. Additionally, BERTweet-base did not perform better than BERT-base-case regardless if we trained it on the entire range or clustered data, which implies that ELLs‚Äô essays contain a different vocabulary than Tweet vocabulary.

- **Estimating Impact of Mileage on Used Car Pricing in Indian Market**

  As today‚Äôs automobile industry is facing the car-chip shortage worldwide and the entire globe is facing unstable economic conditions caused by the pandemic and inflation, buyers are shifting their focus towards pre-owned cars. The car experts provide some broad guidelines and data-based approaches to estimate the factors affecting used car market value. It has been traditionally thought that mileage is the main driver for used car valuation, I seek to examine other factors that may influence the price of used cars, such as the car manufacturers, regular or luxury cars, fuel type, and region. In this study, I would like to answer the below question: ** How much effect the mileage has on the used car valuation in the Indian car market?** Please find the research paper [here](https://github.com/srilamaiti/srilamaiti.github.io/blob/main/assets/Estimating%20Impact%20of%20Mileage%20on%20Used%20Car%20Pricing%20in%20Indian%20Market.pdf).

  **Technical Stack**: R

- **Cancerous Tumor Detection Based On Histopathological Tissue Image**

  In this project, we are trying to identify cancerous tumor identification on histopathological tissue images. We have used CNN-based architecture to identify if a given image is cancerous or not.
